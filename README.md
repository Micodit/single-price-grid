### The challenge

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- BEM naming convention
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I learned how to set up a development environment to code my design as closely as the mockup without a Figma design system template.

- I learned that I should be mindful of accessibility for a wide range of users, thus I learned about `aria-` and `role` attributes, and tools to check text contrast. Although my design didn't use the exact colours in the style guide because of the poor text contrast, I tried to change the colours in a way that both enhanced text contrast and followed the defined design system

### Continued development

- Although I know how the `clamp()` function works, I still have not figured out how to choose the optimal preferred value. I will try to experiment more with this function.

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-label) - This helped to learn more about `aria-label` and `aria-labelledby`
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles) - This helped me to learn more about Aria Roles
